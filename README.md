Palindrome Number Checker Using C
Project Description

This mini project is developed using the C programming language to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome number.

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. The program processes the number using logical operations and compares the reversed value with the original number to produce the result.

Objective

The objectives of this project are:

To understand the fundamentals of C programming

To implement loops and conditional statements

To perform number manipulation using arithmetic operators

To improve logical reasoning and problem-solving skills

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / Any standard C compiler

Program Logic

The program accepts an integer value.

The original number is stored for comparison.

The digits of the number are reversed using an iterative approach.

The reversed number is compared with the original number.

The program determines whether the number is a palindrome.
