A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when reversed.

Example: 121, 343, 989 are palindrome numbers.

The project checks whether a given number is palindrome or not.

User inputs a number through the keyboard.

The original number is stored for comparison.

The number is reversed using a loop.

Each digit is extracted using the modulus (%) operator.

Reversed number is created using arithmetic operations.

The reversed number is compared with the original number.

If both numbers are equal, it is a palindrome.

If not equal, it is not a palindrome.

The program displays the result clearly.

The project uses loops, conditional statements, and functions.

It improves logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Simple and beginner-friendly mini project.

Useful for understanding number manipulation concepts.
